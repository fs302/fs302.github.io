最近读了理查德·汉明的演讲原文[《你和你的研究》(You and Your Research)](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)。其中谈到对科学工作的观察和建议，摘录如下：

> Each of you has one life to live. Even if you believe in reincarnation it doesn't do you any good from one life to the next! Why shouldn't you do significant things in this one life, however you define significant?

一个人只有一次生命，为什么不做一件你认为重大的事?（注意，这个重大是你认为的，不是社会认为的）

> People think great science is done by luck.
> But great work is something else than mere brains.
> Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can

人们往认为重大的工作是靠运气，但汉明认为不是的。重大的工作除了靠脑力外，还需要相信-你相信自己能做重大的问题，作重要的贡献。

> Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. 
> They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory.

伟大的科学家会容忍歧义和混乱，这种平衡有利于创新。

> If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem.
> Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.

潜意识如何帮你做出重要突破？你需要长时间专注一个问题，这个问题足够吸引你，以至于你累得躺在床上的时候，潜意识依然在思考。

> If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?
> If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work.
> Friday afternoons for years - great thoughts only - means that I committed 10% of my time trying to understand the bigger problems in the field

每隔一段时间应思考“什么是我的领域的重要问题”，如果你在做的不是重要问题，问自己为什么要浪费时间搞它。（汉明的做法是，每周五留半天来思考这个问题）

> I should be in the mass production of a variable product. I should be concerned with all of next year's problems, not just the one in front of my face.
> You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will indeed say, Yes, I've stood on so and so's shoulders and I saw further.

要做可以成为别人基石的工作，而不是眼前的一个个流水工作。

> The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things.
>  If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. 

当伟大的科学家发现机会来临时，他会放下手中的一切果断去追逐机会，不要给你的老板机会说“No”，要做出来说服他们。

> When your vision of what you want to do is what you can do single-handedly, then you should pursue it. The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward management. And the bigger the vision is, the farther in management you have to go.

不要轻易去做管理。只有当你的愿景远大于你个人能完成的水平，再考虑去做管理，让更多人和你一起做事。
