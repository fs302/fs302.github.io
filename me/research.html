<h2>ICM2013&ndash;Modeling and Protecting Global Ecological Networks</h2>
<p><b>[Solution for MCM/ICM(Mathematical/Interdisciplinary Contest for Modeling) 2013]</b><br />
<i>In Collaboration with Rui-qi Li and Xiang-yu Zhao, Faculty Advisor: Tao Zhou(Feb 5th, 2013)</i></p>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>

<td align="left"><p>In ICM2013, we are asked to build a model to reflect some aspects of Earth's health.</p>
<p>We model both <b>structure</b> and <b>dynamics</b> of the global ecological network. </p>
<p>In our model, a number of local networks are connected via long-range interactions associated with migrant species[see figure 1(d)] and each local network is generated by a trophic-level-based stochastic model[see figure 1(a)-(c)].</p>
<p>Predator-prey dynamics is described by a networked Lotka-Volterra model that accounts for the self-suppression effects on basal species, the biomass flow from preys to predators and the negative feedback loops[see figure 2(a)].</p>
<p>We hold three conclusions: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>(i) The global ecological network is organized in a clustered small-world manner, with in-degree distribution more heterogeneous then out-degree distribution. </p>
</li>
<li><p>(ii) Protecting endangered species, popular preys and predicted-to-be-extinct species is more effective than randomly selected species or influential predators. </p>
</li>
<li><p>(iii) Protecting after entering the fast extinction stage is more effective than at the begining.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key techniques used in our solution:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Networked Lotka-Volterra Dynamics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pining Control</p>
</li>
<li><p>Missing Link Analysis</p>
</li>
<li><p>LeaderRank Algorithm</p>

<h2>Finding Key facts in Arab Spring</h2>
<p><i>Advised by <a href="http://datamining.rutgers.com">Prof.Hui Xiong</a> (March 12th,2013)</i></p>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="image/ArabSpring.png" alt="Model_illustration" width="440px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>The series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa that commenced in 2010 has become known as the &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo;. Interested in this large-sclale movements, I started a data mining experiment via social data to get the feeling of it.</p>
<h3>DataSets</h3>
<p>Using Twitter's search API, I extracted 1000 recent tweets that has keyword &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo; and make a frequent-words list. Based on the ranking, 30 Top words are selected for further study by making each keyword query in twitter and then make their own frequency-words list.</p>
<h3>Viasualization</h3>
<p>To find relationships between every two keywords. I made a tag-network where nodes indicate the key words and directed edges of (A-&gt;B) indicate the frequency that A's query mentioned B.
In the tag-network, We have 30 nodes and 204 edges.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Two crucial countries <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Tunisa</i> are high-lighted in the network, cos the are the first to witness major uprisings.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>&ldquo;Economics, freedom, change&rdquo;</i>, these three words may hint the causes of this event. Economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty is all related to economics. In recent decades, rising living standars and literacy rates, as well as the increased availability of higher education, have resulted in and improved Human Development Index in the affected countries. The tension between rising aspirations and a lack of government reform may have been a contributing factor in all the protests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a big arrow from <i>&ldquo;Benifit&rdquo;</i> to <i>&ldquo;Islamists&rdquo;</i>, it seems that islamists are the winner of &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo;, because the West would not be able to control it.</p>

<h2>Adapt TCP congestion control methods to UDP application</h2>
<p><i>Experimental Task in Tencent (Augest 15th, 2013)</i></p>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="image/Congestion.jpg" alt="congestion" width="440px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>UDP is universally used in instant message(IM) servers here in Tencent because its efficiency. But the problem of UDP transmission is poor reliability and lack of congestion control mechanism.</p>
<p>With Linux socket API, I simulated TCP's reliable transmition rule and congestion control methods. To solve reliable transmit problem, I adapt batch Acknowledgements(ACK) for sender and reciever. And import <i>cwnd</i> to control sending window of data.</p>
<p>I tried four methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Fixed Window</b>: Sending 256 Packets each RTT.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Slow Start</b>: Set <i>cwnd</i>=1 for the begining, double <i>cwnd</i> each RTT if all sending packets are acknowledged.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>AIMD</b>(Additive increase/multiplicative decrease): Set <i>cwnd</i>=1 for the beginning, add 1 to <i>cwnd</i> for each success RTT and halve <i>cwnd</i> for each failed RTT(packet loss happend).</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>TCP Reno</b>: It is a combination of <b>&ldquo;Slow Start&rdquo;</b> and <b>&ldquo;AIMD&rdquo;</b>, if <i>cwnd</i> &lt;= <i>ssthresh</i>, Using <b>Slow Start</b>, else using <b>AIMD</b>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These four methods are demonstrated in figure 1 in the left.</p>
<h3>Experiment Results</h3>
<p>Each methods is tested 5 times in two different bandwidth condition.We tested the <i>Packet Lost</i> and <i>Transmiting Time</i> and draw a plot picture in figure 2. 
Result shows that AIMD &gt; Reno &gt; Slow Start &gt; Fix Window.</p>
