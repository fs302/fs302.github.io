/*Related Techniques*: Link Prediction, Community Detection/

Real-world graphs often exhibit noise and incompleteness due to limitations in data collection.\n

In order to gain a deeper understanding of our users, we propose a tri-level identity resolution approach known as 'Device-Person-Household', supporting for a accurate targeting and effective user engagement strategy.\n 

Link prediction techniques like CN, AA, RA([https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0553 Zhou et al., EPJ'09]) and SEAL([https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09691 Zhang et al., NeuIPS'18]) are employed to establish missing connections and classify relations. \n

Our research has demonstrated that social relations on Taobao exhibit homophily(the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others), which can serve as an additional data source for *user behavior modeling* ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14446 Huang et al., SIGIR'21]) and *item sales modeling* ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14807 Yang et al., TKDE'22]). \n

To further boost the power of social relations in the recommendation, we employ *graph structure learning(GSL)* techniques on the social graph to generate superior recommendations for inactive users([https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288v1 Liu et al., DASFAA'24]), and introduce GraphTranslator([https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07197 Zhang et al., WWW'24]) to conduct *open-ended tasks* on understanding users interests in social context with GNN(Graph Neural Network) and LLM(Large Language Model).\n
